# Prog-o-meter

## About the Prog-o-meter
The prog-o-meter is for tracking your progress during a #100DaysofCode challenge (or any other #100DaysofX challenge). 
You get a graphic overview of how far you are in your challenge, since the prog-o-meter shows completed days and remaining days.
Currently, the prog-o-meter only let's you track your progress in days, but there are plans for many new features, so stay tuned.

## Use the Prog-o-meter
The prog-o-meter is available for anyone to use. Check out [this guide](user_guide.md) on how to download the program, and get started.

## Get involved
The prog-o-meter was started as a project for me to work on during a #100DaysofCode challenge.
I had been looking for an open-source project to contribute to, to get more experience with collaboration and git/github, but I found none that seemed right for me, and honestly, many of them looked too intimidating for me to even know where to start.
Suddenly it hit me, why don't I just start a new project. One that assumes no experience with collaboration on software. One where we  start from scratch, and learn by doing. One where we help each other out, while working on an awesome project, that will feel relevant to new programmers.

The prog-o-meter is made for newbies by a newbie, and I really want you to join. If you are interested, check out the issues for projects to work on. Or if you have an idea for improvement, either a new feature, or something that can be done better in an existing feature, feel more than welcome to open up a new issue, and work with us on improving the prog-o-meter.
If you feel just as overwhelmed as I did, when I was looking for open-source projects, __DO NOT WORRY__. Please open an issue (see how below) and give it as a title "Hi, my name is [your name]". In the comment, introduce yourself, tell me what you are interested in, and a bit about your experience, and I will help you find something to work on.

## Tech
The current version of the prog-o-meter is built in Python 3.4 and the GUI (graphical user interface) is created with Tkinter. You will probably need a little experience with Python before you can start contributing, but please do not feel that you have to be a master. None of us are masters, and anything you have to contribute __IS VALUABLE__. Of course we want the prog-o-meter to be awesome, but more than anything, we want to have fun and help each other learn, and we need a diverse team to do that. 

## How to open an issue
1. Right below the blue words lineaba/prog-o-meter, there is a menu line. Select the tab __Issues__ 
2. Click the green button __New Issue__
3. Give the issue a title 
  *If you want help getting started: write "Hi, my name is [your name]"

4. Leave a comment
  *If you want help getting started: Introduce yourself, what you are interested in, and your experience, and I will help you find something to work on
